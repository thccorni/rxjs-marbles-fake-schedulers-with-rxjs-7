# About

This repo tries to reproduce a problem with `fakeSchedulers` from <https://github.com/cartant/rxjs-marbles>.

Seems it behaves different in v6 <=> v7.

- [package.json.working](package.json.working) contains the working dependency versions
- [package.json](package.json) contains the broken versions

## Getting Started

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
npm t
```
